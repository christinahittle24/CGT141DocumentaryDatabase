                The Keepers is a 2017 documentary series that investigates the 1969 disappearance and murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik, a nun and teacher at Archbishop Keough High School in Baltimore, Maryland. The series explores allegations of abuse that occurred at the school, focusing on "Jane Doe," who claims she was abducted by Sister Cathy and forced to witness her murder. It also details a lawsuit filed by Jane Doe against the Catholic Church and others, which was dismissed.            </p>
